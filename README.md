# C Programming Portfolio

This repository contains my C programming work completed during the first weeks of the course. The projects are organised by week and show my progression from basic programs to more interactive, menu-driven applications.

The work was developed using CLion and version-controlled using GitHub.

## Week 1 – C Fundamentals

In Week 1, I focused on learning the basics of C programming and setting up the development environment.

### Tasks completed:
- **Hello Engineer**  
  My first C program, used to understand the structure of a C program and how to print output using `printf`.

- **Speed Converter**  
  A program that converts speed from metres per second (m/s) to miles per hour (mph). This task introduced variables, user input using `scanf`, basic calculations, and formatted output.

### Skills practiced:
- Writing and running basic C programs
- Using `printf` and `scanf`
- Understanding input, process, and output
- Using CLion with CMake
- Committing work to GitHub

## Week 2 – Decision Making and User Interaction

In Week 2, I built on the fundamentals by creating programs that respond to user input and make decisions using conditional statements.

### Tasks completed:
- **Speed Checker**  
  Used `if / else` statements to determine whether a speed is within the limit or speeding.

- **Speed Classifier**  
  Extended the logic using `else if` to classify speeds as Slow, Normal, or Speeding.

- **Speed Validator**  
  Added input validation to handle invalid values, such as negative speeds, before processing.

### Extension – Menu Program
As an extension task, I created a menu-driven program using a `switch` statement and a loop. The program allows the user to:
1. Check a speed
2. Convert speed from m/s to mph
3. Exit the program

The menu repeats after each action and includes a short delay before returning, improving usability. This extension helped me understand how loops, conditionals, and user interaction work together in a single program.

Each task folder contains the C source code and a `designs` folder with pseudocode used during planning.

## Notes
This repository is intended to show learning progress rather than polished final software. Design files and commit history are included to demonstrate the development process.
