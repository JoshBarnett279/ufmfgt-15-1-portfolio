### Week 1 – Introduction to C Programming

**Overview:**  
In Week 1, I focused on getting set up with CLion and learning the basics of programming in C. This included writing my first simple programs and understanding how input and output work.

**What I learned:**  
This week helped me understand the basic structure of a C program and how everything runs from the `main` function. I learned how to print text using `printf` and how to take input from the user using `scanf`. I also learned how variables are used to store values and how simple calculations can be performed in code.

**Challenges and solutions:**  
At first, I ran into problems with my code not compiling, mainly due to missing semicolons and using `scanf` incorrectly. By looking at the compiler error messages in CLion and fixing the lines it pointed to, I slowly got used to how strict C syntax is.

**Reflection:**  
Week 1 helped me get more confident with both the C language and the development environment. Writing a simple speed converter made it easier to understand how programs follow an input, process, and output structure, which helped prepare me for more complex tasks later on.

### Week 2 – Decision Making and Menu Programs

**Overview:**  
Week 2 introduced decision making in C using conditional statements and more interactive programs that respond to user input.

**What I learned:**  
I learned how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to control how a program behaves depending on conditions. I also learned why input validation is important, for example checking for negative values before processing data. Later in the week, I learned how to use `switch` statements and loops to create menu-based programs that can run repeatedly.

**Challenges and solutions:**  
One of the main challenges was getting the logic in my conditional statements correct. I initially used separate `if` statements instead of an `if / else if` chain, which caused the program to behave incorrectly. Rewriting the logic in the correct order fixed this and helped me understand how conditions are checked step by step.

**Reflection:**  
Week 2 helped me understand how small pieces of code can be combined into a larger program. Creating the menu-based program showed how loops, conditionals, and user input all work together, and it made the programs feel more like real applications rather than single-use scripts.
