**Reflection:**  
Short paragraph on how this week helped your understanding or confidence.

Week 1 – Introduction to C Programming

Overview:
In Week 1, I focused on getting used to CLion and understanding the basics of C programming. I completed some design tasks first, such as writing pseudocode and creating a traffic light flowchart, before moving on to writing my first C programs including a hello program and a speed converter.

What I learned:

How a C program runs from "main()"

How to use "printf()" to display output

How to use "scanf()" to read user input

How to declare variables and carry out simple calculations

Why planning with pseudocode makes coding easier

How to build and run programs in CLion

Challenges and solutions:
At the beginning, I had a few issues with small syntax mistakes like missing semicolons and incorrect "scanf()" usage. I also had some problems getting the correct run configuration in CLion. By carefully reading the compiler errors and checking my code step by step, I was able to fix these problems and understand what went wrong.

Reflection:
Week 1 helped me feel more comfortable with both C and the development environment. The speed converter especially helped me understand how input, processing, and output fit together in a program.

Week 2 – Selection Statements

Overview:
This week introduced conditional statements and decision-making in C. I worked with "if", "else if", "else", and "switch" statements to control how programs respond to user input.

What I learned:

How conditions are checked in order

Why the placement of conditions matters

How to use logical operators such as "&&" and "||"

How to validate user input properly

How to build simple menu-based programs

Challenges and solutions:
Sometimes my conditions were not in the correct order, which led to incorrect outputs. I fixed this by reorganising the structure and testing different input values to make sure each case worked properly.

Reflection:
This week improved my logical thinking. I feel more confident writing programs that make decisions and handle different situations correctly.

Week 3 – Nested Logic and Validation

Overview:
In Week 3, I developed more complex decision structures, including nested "if" statements and validation systems such as mark classification and age verification programs.

What I learned:

How nested "if" statements work

How to validate value ranges correctly

The importance of checking invalid input first

How logical structure affects the overall behaviour of a program

Challenges and solutions:
One challenge was making sure invalid values were handled before other conditions. I improved this by testing boundary cases and reviewing the order of my logic carefully.

Reflection:
Week 3 made me more aware of how small logic mistakes can change the outcome of a program. I now feel more confident structuring more detailed conditional systems.

Week 4 – Arrays and Loops

Overview:
This week focused on arrays and loops to handle multiple pieces of data. I created programs that calculated totals, averages, and identified the highest and lowest values from a set of inputs.

What I learned:

How to declare and use arrays

How "for" and "while" loops operate

How array indexing starts from 0

How to calculate averages and track minimum and maximum values

Challenges and solutions:
At first, I found array indexing and loop limits slightly confusing. I solved this by carefully tracing through the loop logic and checking that my loop conditions were correct.

Reflection:
Week 4 was a big improvement in my understanding. Working with arrays made my programs feel more complete and structured, and I am now more confident handling larger sets of data.
